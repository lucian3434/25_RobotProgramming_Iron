CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /root/codes/iron_yahboomcar_ws/build/yahboomcar_slam/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /root/yahboomcar_ros2_ws/yahboomcar_ws/build/yahboomcar_slam where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
